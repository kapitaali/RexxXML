<!-- A dreary poem -->
<poem><stanza><line>Winter has come early.</line>
         <line>The frost has iced over the empty fields</line>
         <line>and ruined the late corn.</line>
         <line>It will be a cold November.</line>
 </stanza>	 
 <stanza><line>Once I &thoughtverb;ed why the world was so cruel</line>
         <line>but I have given up &thoughtverb;ing,</line>
         <line>for who can say how the North wind blows?</line>
 </stanza></poem>
